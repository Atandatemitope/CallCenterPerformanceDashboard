***

### Introduction 
---

This dataset captures customer support interactions from January to March 2021, offering a glimpse into various topics like contracts, technical issues, payments, and more. Each entry includes call details, agent names, resolution status, speed of response, and satisfaction ratings. The interactions highlight patterns and efficiency in addressing customer concerns. Notably, the dataset concludes/ or last updated in March 2021, summarizing a three-month span of customer-agent engagements. It provides accessible insights into the dynamics of support interactions during this period.

#### Statement problem:

Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire(Manager ) that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. 
Possible KPIs include (get you started, but not limited):
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls were answered/abandoned.
- Calls by time
- The average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered.

**Project Objectives:** 

As a data analyst in this project, my main responsibility is to analyze the inbound calls answered and left abandoned data of Call Center database, insights and also build a Power BI dashboard to visualize customer satisfaction which will improve the call handling time and speed of call answered as well as creation statistical report of agents will help team lead or operation head to analyze the performance of agents for appraisal.


_The purpose of this project was to find out the call trend over time and to find out how to sort out any issue with how they communicate with their customers._

_**Data Collection:**_ The dataset was gotten from PWC. The dataset features 5000 Calls from 01/01/2021 to 31/03/2021.


**Tool used**: PowerBi 

### Data Analysis and Preparation 

The following steps are involved in creating the Dashboard: 
1 Data exploration
2 Extract data 
3 Load data 
4 Data cleaning
5 Dax writing 
6 Report building 
7 Publishing into Powerbi Service 


- Data exploration to understand its structure and content.
- Extraction and loading into Power Query Editor for cleaning, addressing missing or redundant entries.
- Transformation of data, including converting "Call answered" and "Resolved" indicators to "Yes/No" format for clarity.
- Addition of new columns to enhance data quality and facilitate analysis.
- Creation of a satisfaction rating status column using conditional statements.
- Data loaded into Power BI Desktop environment for visualization.


**Satisfaction rating status** : How did i create that? I used a conditional column in power query editor environment to achieve that, since i already had satisfaction rating column with items ranging from 1-5. 

The metric used for satisfaction rating was:

If the satisfaction rating is equal to 1 then very dissatisfied, and if equal 2 dissatisfied and ,if equal 3 neutral and if equal 4 satisfied, and Else very satisfied. 

After the whole data cleaning process, I loaded back the data into powerbi destktop environment for data visualization. 

To achieve the KPIs and other insights the below are the skills demonstrated 
- Dax ( SUM FUNCTION, DIVIDE, CALCULATE, AVERAGE and etc )
- PowerPoint report canva design 
- Slicer 
- Color formating 
- Charts ( Table, line chart, and donut chart and gauge)
- Charts design 


Since its just a single table then there was no reason for creating data modeling hence, I carried out writing some DAX to achieve my KPIs such as 

- Total call
- Answered / Unswered Call and it's percentage %
- Resolved/Unresolved call and it's percentage %
- Average of answer calls in seconds 

The DAX and functions overview 
Sum function 
Calculate function 
Average function 
Divide function 

KPIs 
Total call = 5000
Answered call = 4,054
Unaswered call = 946
Call resolution = 3,646
Unresolved call = 1,354
Average of answers call in seconds = 67.52
Average satisfaction rating = 3.40 

Other Insights 
- What cases received most resolutions among the call topic : To achieve this, I used Donut chart to visualized individual topic from Admin support, contract related, streaming, Technical support  and Payment related. 

Most cases was from Streaming service and At 749 with 20.45%, we can look critically into the Streaming service to see the reason why major complan were coming from them and notably the agents in the Streaming service should be commended for their professionalism in how they handled the customers and how they have been able to proffer solution to the customer's complaint. 

- Average Satisfaction Rating: 3.45 out of 5 star rating shows a positive satisfaction by the customers. This indicate that most of the cases were resolved up to the satisfaction of the customers. 

- Customers satisfaction rating status: Majority of the customers statisfaction status falls under the neutral catergory at 30% and at 29% the customers were satisfied with the feedback they got from the company's agent. 

- Busiest hour of the day: The busiest hour of the day falls around 11AM in the morning and precisely on Monday, this could be that customers had major issue over the weekend and they could not really enjoy the company's service provided over the weeend. This must be critically look into on how the customers would enjoy the service paid for over the weekend without interuption. 

- Average speed of calls answers in seconds : Clearly Becky is the agent with most speed of answer at 65.33 while Dan has the most percentage of call answer at 82.6% the company might need to find out the strategry at which these guys are using to ensure their uptimum performance and they may encourage the agent such as Joe and Martha to utilize that to ensure uptimum performance in their dealing with the customers.
